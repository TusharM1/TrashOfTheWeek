		<div class="text-container">
			<p>We are almost through month 8 of documenting the weekly trash.
				Usually, people wait until some big milestone to celebrate how
				consistent they have been, but every week I take these photos
				I remind myself of what it means to be consistent.</p>
			<p>This week was a real average of what it’s all about. There’s
				nothing too out of the ordinary here, and maybe that’s a good
				thing. If every week is exciting, is any week really?</p>
			<p>Three main categories this week: consumables, fragrance, and wrappers.</p>
			<p>This week was almost a perfect snapshot of what the average
				American might consume in the course of a week. Everything
				from food and drink, to used containers and scraps, my trash
				had it all. One particular wrapper has an interesting story
				behind it… But first, let’s review this week’s trash!</p>
		</div>

		<h2 id="Gallery">Gallery</h2>
		<h3>Consumables:</h3>
		<div class="image_container">
			<img src="img/enchilada.jpeg" alt="Enchilada Bowl">
			<img src="img/soda_cup.jpeg" alt="Soda Cup">
			<img src="img/receipt.jpeg" alt="Receipt">
		</div>
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>This category has everything to do with food and drink. The two things I consumed this week, an
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexican_cuisine">enchilada bowl</a> and a <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink">cup of soda</a> were very tasty but probably not
				that good for you. I did a bit of grocery shopping this week where I picked up a lot of food and drink,
				so I figured the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt">receipt</a> would fit well into this
				category.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Fragrance:</h3>
		<div class="image_container">
			<img src="img/air_wick.jpeg" alt="Air Wick">
			<img src="img/hand_sanitizer.jpeg" alt="Hand Sanitizer">
			<img src="img/body_wash.jpeg" alt="Body Wash">
		</div>
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>This is a bit of a looser categorization, but I think it still fits pretty well. I got this <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Wick">AirWick</a> a few weeks ago and it just finished. It was a
				fall season one anyway, no big deal. My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_gel">body wash</a>
				just finished but during my grocery shopping, I also picked up some more body wash since I was running
				out. Lastly, I just ran through the last of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_sanitizer">hand
					sanitizer</a>, I kind of liked clinical, toxic smell from the unscented kind.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Wrappers:</h3>
		<div class="image_container">
			<img src="img/film_wrapper.jpeg" alt="Film Wrapper">
			<img src="img/paper_bag.jpeg" alt="Paper Bag">
			<img src="img/keychain.jpeg" alt="Key Chain Wrapper">
		</div>
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>In this category, I combined everything that was a package containing something else. The <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_bag">mangled bag</a> was from a shopping trip the week prior
				that I forgot to throw out. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_film#Polaroid">polaroid
					packaging</a> was from a friend who left it here when she opened it to take a polaroid photo. The <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain">keychain packaging</a> was from something I received
				from a website called Chess.com, it was a very cool keychain in the shape of a chess pawn.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Item of the week: Keychain packaging.</h3>
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>This was my favorite item from the week because I received this as a gift from Chess.com, it is a really
				nice keychain, and it came in this cute little packaging. I put it on my keychain, and it really makes
				it stand out and identify it as my own.</p>

			<p>Thank you so much for reading this week’s Trash of the Week, where we looked at an array of different
				trash from across the board. Next week, you will see the packaging from a new guitar amp I just bought.
				Until next time, have a good one! </p>
