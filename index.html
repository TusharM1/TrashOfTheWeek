    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>We are almost through month 8 of documenting the weekly trash.
        Usually, people wait until some big milestone to celebrate how
        consistent they have been, but every week I take these photos
        I remind myself of what it means to be consistent.</p>
      <p>This week was a real average of what it’s all about. There’s
        nothing too out of the ordinary here, and maybe that’s a good
        thing. If every week is exciting, is any week really?</p>
      <p>Three main categories this week: consumables, fragrance, and wrappers.</p>
      <p>This week was almost a perfect snapshot of what the average
        American might consume in the course of a week. Everything
        from food and drink, to used containers and scraps, my trash
        had it all. One particular wrapper has an interesting story
        behind it… But first, let’s review this week’s trash!</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="Gallery">Gallery</h2>
    <h3>Consumables:</h3>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img src="img/enchilada.jpeg" alt="Enchilada Bowl">
      <img src="img/soda_cup.jpeg" alt="Soda Cup">
      <img src="img/receipt.jpeg" alt="Receipt">
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>This category has everything to do with food and drink. The
        two things I consumed this week, an enchilada bowl and a cup
        of soda were very tasty but probably not that good for you.
        I did a bit of grocery shopping this week where I picked up
        a lot of food and drink, so I figured this would fit well
        into this category.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Fragrance:</h3>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img src="img/air_wick.jpeg" alt="Air Wick">
      <img src="img/hand_sanitizer.jpeg" alt="Hand Sanitizer">
      <img src="img/body_wash.jpeg" alt="Body Wash">
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>This is a bit of a looser categorization, but I think it still
        fits pretty well. I got this AirWick a few weeks ago and it just
        finished. It was a fall season one anyway, no big deal. My body
        wash just finished but during my grocery shopping, I also picked
        up some more body wash since I was running out. Lastly, I just
        ran through the last of my hand sanitizer, I kind of liked clinical,
        toxic smell from the unscented kind.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Wrappers:</h3>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img src="img/film_wrapper.jpeg" alt="Film Wrapper">
      <img src="img/paper_bag.jpeg" alt="Paper Bag">
      <img src="img/keychain.jpeg" alt="Key Chain Wrapper">
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>In this category, I combined everything that was a package
        containing something else. The mangled bag was from a shopping
        trip the week prior that I forgot to throw out. The polaroid
        packaging was from a friend who left it here when she opened
        it to take a polaroid photo. The keychain packaging was from
        something I received from a website called Chess.com, it was
        a very cool keychain in the shape of a chess pawn.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Item of the week: Keychain packaging.</h3>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>This was my favorite item from the week because I received
        this as a gift from Chess.com, it is a really nice keychain,
        and it came in this cute little packaging. I put it on my
        keychain, and it really makes it stand out and identify
        it as my own.</p>
