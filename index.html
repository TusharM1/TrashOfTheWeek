		<div class="text-container">
			<p>Can you believe it? We are almost through the eight month of this Trash of the Week project! Usually,
				people wait until they reach some big milestone like one year to celebrate how consistent they have
				been, but every week I take these photos, I remind myself what it means to be consistent. But before we
				delve into the trash this week, lets remind ourselves why I do this. </p>
			<p>The reason why I have been doing this project every week to be conscientious of the impact I have on the
				environment. As I have reiterated many times in previous Trash of the Week updates, the environment is
				an important part of everyone’s life. Treating it well and keeping in mind the impact you are having on
				it is the first step to improving the environment for everyone. What you may not see is the things I
				don’t throw out, the things I give away, the things I reuse and repurpose, the things that I repair and
				continue to use. Every single thing I document on this page is a reminder of the improvements we can
				make as a society to eliminate waste and decrease consumption.</p>
			<p>The ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bogost">Ian Bogost</a> come to mind when thinking
				about the goal of this project. Ontography, a term that for this context means the study of “the human
				response to the physical landscape” (36), is particularly relevant here when talking about environmental
				issues. Aside from the most important one being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">climate
					change</a>, other environmental issues may not be as well known, such <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill">landfills</a> and trash disposal issues. A quote from
				his essay, “an ontograph is a landfill, not a Japanese garden. It shows how much rather than how little
				exists simultaneously, suspended in the dense meanwhile of being”(59), sheds some light on how this
				entire project is an ontograph in its own way. Being a reflection of ourselves and our impact on the
				world, this project is a mirror of societies daily life. In a thousand years, the ontograph of a trash
				of the week project will indeed look very different, reflective of a different society with different
				values.</p>
			<p>Analyzing the content of this week’s trash, it’s a real average of what the last several weeks have been.
				Here we have a little bit of everything. There’s nothing too out of the ordinary here and that means its
				been a bit of an uneventful week. It sure feels like it. But look at it this way, if every week were
				exciting, would any week really be?</p>
			<p>The three main categories this week are: consumables, fragrances, and wrappers. Although these categories
				don’t really fit exactly, I think they are close enough of an association for the categorization to be
				warranted. Hopefully, you don’t think its too much of a stretch. </p>
			<p>This week was almost a perfect snapshot of what the average American might consume in the course of a
				week. Everything from food and drink, to used containers and scraps, my trash had it all. One particular
				wrapper has an interesting story behind it… But first, let’s review this week’s trash!</p>
		</div>

		<h2 id="Gallery">Gallery</h2>
		<h3>Consumables:</h3>
		<div class="image_container">
			<img src="img/enchilada.jpeg" alt="Enchilada Bowl">
			<img src="img/soda_cup.jpeg" alt="Soda Cup">
			<img src="img/receipt.jpeg" alt="Receipt">
		</div>
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>This category has everything to do with food and drink. The two things I consumed this week, an
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexican_cuisine">enchilada bowl</a> and a <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink">cup of soda</a> were very tasty but probably not
				that good for you. I did a bit of grocery shopping this week where I picked up a lot of food and drink,
				so I figured the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt">receipt</a> would fit well into this
				category.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Fragrance:</h3>
		<div class="image_container">
			<img src="img/air_wick.jpeg" alt="Air Wick">
			<img src="img/hand_sanitizer.jpeg" alt="Hand Sanitizer">
			<img src="img/body_wash.jpeg" alt="Body Wash">
		</div>
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>This is a bit of a looser categorization, but I think it still fits pretty well. I got this <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Wick">AirWick</a> a few weeks ago and it just finished. It was a
				fall season one anyway, no big deal. My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_gel">body wash</a>
				just finished but during my grocery shopping, I also picked up some more body wash since I was running
				out. Lastly, I just ran through the last of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_sanitizer">hand
					sanitizer</a>, I kind of liked clinical, toxic smell from the unscented kind.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Wrappers:</h3>
		<div class="image_container">
			<img src="img/film_wrapper.jpeg" alt="Film Wrapper">
			<img src="img/paper_bag.jpeg" alt="Paper Bag">
			<img src="img/keychain.jpeg" alt="Key Chain Wrapper">
		</div>
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>In this category, I combined everything that was a package containing something else. The <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_bag">mangled bag</a> was from a shopping trip the week prior
				that I forgot to throw out. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_film#Polaroid">polaroid
					packaging</a> was from a friend who left it here when she opened it to take a polaroid photo. The <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain">keychain packaging</a> was from something I received
				from a website called Chess.com, it was a very cool keychain in the shape of a chess pawn.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Item of the week: Keychain packaging.</h3>
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>This was my favorite item from the week because I received this as a gift from Chess.com, it is a really
				nice keychain, and it came in this cute little packaging. I put it on my keychain, and it really makes
				it stand out and identify it as my own.</p>
